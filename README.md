## General Information
- On the dataset, multiple linear regression is carried out.
- The project is completed as part of the Machine Learning module's coursework. 
- We are attempting to determine how many leases the company has issued based on a variety of independent factors, like temperature, weather, humidity, holidays, etc. 
- It makes use of the Boombikes bike rental dataset.

## Conclusions
- 1. The R-squared value of the model is 82.04%, suggesting that our model accurately and comprehensively describes the variance on the test set. As a result, we can say that the model is good.

- 2. We can infer that the temperature and whether it is a working day or not affect the bike needs for the BoomBikes company. 

- 3. In addition, it appears that demand for rentals is higher in the winter than it is in the summer and spring. We had seen that rental activity was increased in September and October. The focus was mostly on holidays rather than days like Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

- 4. According to one of the recommendations based on this model, extensive marketing should be done in the spring and summer to increase rental rates.

- 5. A solid marketing plan for the first six months of the year can help increase rental rates because the summertime also exhibits low rental levels. 

- 6. On days when the weather is less clear, there must be a strategy to introduce more users, possibly with rewards or clever bargains. 

- 7. Rentals increased in 2019 compared to 2018, which shows that more people will become aware of this concept over time. To keep repeat clients, a thorough study must be conducted.s
